## üìå Case Study :  
 # GPU Allocation in a Colab-Style Environment

A very simple scheduler matches user requests (Free, Pro, Pro+) to available GPUs (K80, T4, V100, A100) using:

1. Two priority queues (High and Low)  
2. A sorted list of idle GPUs  
3. A ‚Äúbest-fit‚Äù rule to pick the smallest GPU that meets each user‚Äôs need

---

## 1. Queues and GPU List

### 1.1. High-Priority Queue (`HEAP_HIGH`)
- Holds only **Pro+** users  
- Ordered by the time they requested a GPU (earliest first)  
- Each entry contains:
  - `user_id`  
  - `min_gpu_rank` (1=small job, 2=medium, 3=large)  
  - `arrival_time`  

### 1.2. Low-Priority Queue (`HEAP_LOW`)
- Holds **Pro** and **Free** users  
- Within this queue, Pro users go before Free users; among the same type, earlier requests go first  
- Each entry contains:
  - `user_id`  
  - `min_gpu_rank` (1=small, 2=medium, 3=large)  
  - `arrival_time`  

### 1.3. Idle GPUs List (`IDLE_LIST`)
- A list of all currently free GPUs, **sorted from lowest to highest rank**:
  1. K80 ‚Üí rank 1  
  2. T4  ‚Üí rank 2  
  3. V100 ‚Üí rank 3  
  4. A100 ‚Üí rank 4  
- Each entry shows:
  - `gpu_id`  
  - `gpu_type`  
  - `rank`  

---

## 2. How It Works

### 2.1. When a User Requests a GPU
1. User clicks **‚ÄúEnable GPU.‚Äù**  
2. Collect the user‚Äôs:
   - `user_id`  
   - `tier` (Free / Pro / Pro+)  
   - `job_size` (small / medium / large)  
   - `arrival_time` (timestamp)  
3. Decide `min_gpu_rank` based on `job_size`:
   - small ‚Üí 1  
   - medium ‚Üí 2  
   - large ‚Üí 3  
4. Put the request into:
   - **`HEAP_HIGH`** if the user is **Pro+**  
   - **`HEAP_LOW`** if the user is **Pro** or **Free** (Pro before Free)  
5. Show the user: ‚ÄúWaiting for GPU.‚Äù

### 2.2. When a GPU Becomes Free
1. Add the freed GPU into `IDLE_LIST` in the correct spot so it stays sorted by rank.  
2. Decide which queue to take from:
   - If `HEAP_HIGH` is not empty, pop its earliest entry.  
   - Otherwise, pop the earliest entry from `HEAP_LOW`.  
   - If both are empty, stop (no one is waiting).  
3. Take the popped request‚Äôs `min_gpu_rank` and scan `IDLE_LIST` from lowest rank to highest:
   - As soon as you find a GPU whose rank ‚â• `min_gpu_rank`, assign that GPU to the user and remove it from `IDLE_LIST`.  
   - If you reach the end without finding a match (all ranks are too low), put the request back into its original queue.  
4. Repeat whenever another GPU opens up or a new request arrives.
